# Tic-Tac-Toe Game
This repository contains my first-ever creation of a Tic-Tac-Toe Game. Using the Minimax Algorithm, implemented an AI to play the game optimally. The game usually ends in a tie, given optimal play by both sides (User and AI). You will never be able to beat the AI (though if you donâ€™t play optimally as well, it may beat you!)
